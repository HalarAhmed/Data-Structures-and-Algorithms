# Data Structures and Algorithms

I’ve just started my DSA journey and this repo is going to be my personal tracker for everything I learn. Whether it’s a YouTube lecture, or a problem solved, or simply my understanding of any algorithm on LeetCode or GFG or HackerRank — it all goes here.

I’ll be uploading:
- Code and notes from every lecture I watch
- Solutions to DSA problems from platforms like LeetCode, GFG, etc.
- Explanations (wherever I feel it’s needed for future revision)

## Folder Structure

- `lectures/`  
  This folder contains code files and notes from DSA lectures I watch.  
  I mostly follow structured playlists on YouTube — one concept at a time.

- `problems/`  
  This folder has all the problems I solve from platforms like LeetCode, GFG, etc.  
  Each subfolder may contain:
    - Problem link (in comments or markdown)
    - Code solution
    - Short notes or approach (if required)

## Why I’m Doing This

- To stay consistent and not lose track of what I’ve learned.
- To build a personal library of concepts and solutions.
- For future revision — everything in one place.
- To make myself accountable and regular.
