# Data Structures and Algorithms

Hi, I’m **Halar Ahmed**. I’ve just started my journey into **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in **C++** and created this repository to keep track of my progress. 

I’ll be uploading all my lecture notes and code files here as soon as I watch new lectures on YouTube. This way I can have everything organized in one place and look back at how much I’ve learned over time.

---

## What’s in this repo?

- C++ implementations of DSA concepts covered in lectures
- Code files directly from my personal notes
- Some small practice problems and their solutions

---

## Why this repo?

I wanted a dedicated space to:
- Document my learning process
- Upload my code regularly after each lecture
- Make it easier to review and revise whenever needed

---

## How to use?

Just browse through the folders and files here on GitHub to see my code and notes.
